gcore_with_breakpoint is made from gcore sh script in gdb.

You can get core file with setting breakpoint without stopping process.
In a narrow sense, though it attach and stop the process in a moment, it's negligible effect.
You can also get multi core files from multi processes by program name by "-n". or multi pid.

The usage is following.

  usage: gcore_with_breakpoint [-o filename] [-b breakpoint] [-n prog_name | pid]

If the process goes in the breakpoint, you can stop by Ctrl-C.
The breakpoint expression is following. (same as gdb)

  -b "functionname"
  -b "filename:functionname"
  -b "filename:linenumber"
  -b "*address"


Sample1:

The target program name is "zabbix_agentd".
Then, you can get core.7995 which breaks at "common.c:140".

# gcore_with_breakpoint -b "common.c:140" -n zabbix_agentd

Sample2:

The target program name is "zabbix_agentd".
Then, you can get zabbix_agentd_core.7995 which breaks at "*0x40e143".
"*0x40e143" is address of "common.c:140".
If you don't have debug symbol, you cannot set breakpoint by "common.c:140".
But you can set "*0x40e143" if you know the address of "common.c:140".
It's helpful when your customer don't have debug symbol but you have one.
